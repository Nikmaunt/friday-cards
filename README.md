# About The Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create your own cards and share them with other students. Study your and friend's cards. Evaluate your knowledge, and in case of a low score, the question will be repeated again (using smart random) for a better learning experiense.

You can create custom cards with pictures.

Happy studying!
